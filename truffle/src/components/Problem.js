              With the Blitz FilmCoin we are starting a new era in film funding
              and production. We have created the Blitz FilmCoin which enables
              us to fund the post-production and distribution of the film. The
              coin entitles its holders to participate in the revenues which the
              film will generate throughout its entire lifecycle in a fair and
              fully transparent manner. This token framework will later be used
              to fund other independent films with a strong artistic vision,
              commercial potential and audience appeal.{" "}
